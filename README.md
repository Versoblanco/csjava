## About

This is an archive of the Java coding assigments I wrote for the course [_Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java) of Princeton University, available in Coursera or in the [booksite](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/)


## License

Assigments descriptions are cited in each file and linked to the source in order to provide some context. They belong to their authors Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne © 2000–2019.

I wrote the code for learning purposes but you can find the "official" solutions or very similar problems in https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/code/.
